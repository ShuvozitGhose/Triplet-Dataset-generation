# Triplet Dataset generation in FlickersLogos32 Dataset
FlickersLogos32 Dataset contain original images and their respective mask images. This code creates data triplet consists of original image, logo image and mask image. In the positive dataset, the original image contains the logo that is present in the logo image. In the Negative dataset, the original image does not contain the logo that is present in the logo image.
This is the data preparation step of the paper **A Deep One-Shot Network for Query-based Logo Retrieval [[paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320319302626?dgcid=rss_sd_all)]** published in **Pattern Recognition 2019, Elsevier**.
